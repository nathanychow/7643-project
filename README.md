# Final Project for OMS CS-7643 Deep Learning
# Instructions for Project Proposal

### What goes in a project proposal?

* Team Name
* Is this a Facebook project? (not relevant for summer term)
* Project Title
* Project summary (4-5+ sentences). Fill in your problem and background/motivation (why do you want to solve it? Why is it interesting?). This should provide some detail (don’t just say “I’ll be working on object detection”)
* What you will do (Approach, 4-5+ sentences) - Be specific about what you will implement and what existing code you will use. Describe what you actually plan to implement or the experiments you might try, etc. Again, provide sufficient information describing exactly what you’ll do. One of the key things to note is that just downloading code and running it on a dataset is not sufficient for a description or a project! Some thorough implementation, analysis, theory, etc. has to be done for the project.
* Resources / Related Work & Papers (4-5+ sentences). What is the state of art for this problem? Note that it is perfectly fine for this project to implement approaches that already exist. This part should show you’ve done some research about what approaches exist.
* Datasets (Provide a Link to the dataset). This is crucial! Deep learning is data-driven, so what datasets you use is crucial. One of the key things is to make sure you don’t try to create and especially annotate your own data! Otherwise the project will be taken over by this.
* List your Group members.
* Are you looking for more members?
* Piazza post link.

### Where are project proposals submitted/graded?
  * Groups will submit the project proposal twice, once in canvas and once on piazza.
  * Canvas is for grading
  * Piazza is for classmates to see proposals and facilitate group completion.
      * students without groups can look through proposals and reach out to teams still looking for groups.
      * This post doesnt have to be perfect, make this early if your group is looking for additional members.
      * Include the link to your piazza post (be sure to include the follow-up number) in your proposal submission on canvas.


## What you and your groups need to do right now:
In summary:
* join groups in canvas. (each team member must join the group individually, please do this as you will not be graded if you don't)
* draft a project proposal with groupmates
* post project proposal to this piazza thread. (sample Proposal posted in this thread.)
* Add a link to your post in the project proposal, finalize it and submit to canvas as a pdf (this document will be graded)
    * project proposals are not a "one shot" submission, you are free to refine it until the deadline and resubmit.
* groups will be locked after the proposal due date in canvas.
* If your group is still looking for members, other students may express interest in your project and reach out. Have them join your group in canvas and update your proposal accordingly.
